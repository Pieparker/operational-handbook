# Introduction
Congratulations on procuring your very own Scott! This operational handbook aims to outline how to get the best out of him.

# What are your primary goals as a human being?
- To be joyous and bring joy.
- To contribute positively and effectively, at work and beyond. I like to help and I like to know. I feel empowered as a valuable port of call for people.
- To remain fair and view situations holistically.
- To be a positive rolemodel.

# What do you want us to know about your communication style?
- I love to be certain about what I'm saying. If you're blessed with in-depth sync conversation with me, please note that I've
 probably spent a lot of time making sure that I know what I'm talking about. Otherwise, I feel like I'm winging it. This is perhaps because I don't like to be, what I call, _needlessly wrong_ (see last section).
- If I don't know something, I'll preface that my educated guess is an educated guess and probably waffle a bit.
- I'm honest!

# What are some useful things to know in advance about your style?
- I use emojis a lot; they help to delicately portray my tone. I'd hate for somebody to think I was being short and sharp when I'm really not.
- If we have a healthy, friendly working relationship, I'll probably end up talking quite colloquially with plenty of local dialogue. Yet, if I'm talking to, say, customers, I'll put my business acumen pants on and make sure that I send a linguistically and technically sound response.
- I try not to presume anything because that's where mistakes are made. Please, don't think that you've explained something poorly if I follow up with a couple of very simple questions.

# How can you best work with me?
- Question me and get me backpedalling. Make me rubber duck.
- Trust me but check in on me. Let's sitrep.

# What are your pet peeves?
- Rudeness. I can tell the difference between "we probably shouldn't do that and here's why" versus "you're wrong and I'm better than you". The latter is not encouraging.
- Not being asked to contribute to a plan which I'm expected to execute. Take me on the journey.
- Negligence. Saying "I didn't think this needed doing" or "I thought it would get picked up by _x_". Assumptions can be rather detrimental.

# What are your self-perceived biggest shortcomings?
- Being _needlessly wrong_. I recognise that I'm not omniscient but, if someone's taken the time to ask me something, I'm not happy unless I know the answer. If I don't know the answer or can't find it in a quick pinch, I'll either work with you to figure it out, work on it with you in parallel or, at least, ask you how it was done.
